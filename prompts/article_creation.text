Your task is to write about the topic below:
--------------------------------
{topic}
--------------------------------
You need to write a deep dive on the topic with technical details as well as explained it to the mass. 
You instructions are below for each field. Don't make up stuff. Use the internet to look up the latest information about the topic.
Use Wikipedia and other credible sites when researching the topic.



Title: [A catchy and informative title that includes keywords.]
Eli5: [Explain the main point to someone like they ar 5. Add one or two pop culture references in.]


Introduction:
[Start with a compelling story, a surprising statistic, or a relatable problem to hook the reader. Briefly introduce the machine learning concept or problem you will be discussing and explain why it is important or interesting. State the goal of your article and what the reader will learn.]

The Core Concept:
[This is where you dive into the main topic. Explain the topic again but to a fellow learner who has knowledge about the field. Use technical language.
What it is: Explain the machine learning concept, algorithm, or model in simple terms. Use analogies and jargon where possible.
How it works: Provide a high-level overview of the mechanics. You can use bullet points or a numbered list to break down the steps.
Why it's useful: Discuss the real-world applications and the types of problems it can solve.
This introduction should have at least 1 to 2 paragraphs with at least 500 words.]

Tutorial:
[Create a simple tutorial in code for this topic in python. 
You are only allow to use pytorch, pandas, numpy, matplolib, huggingface, llamaindex, and other relevance Machine learning libraries.
Make the tutorial as simple as possible to only show the topic: {topic}. The tutorial should be python code. Also include the libraries being used.

]

Key Takeaways 
[Summarize the main points of the article. What are the three to five most important things you want your reader to remember? You can also discuss any challenges you faced, limitations of the model, or potential future improvements.]

Conclusion:
 [End with a strong concluding paragraph. Briefly recap the problem you addressed and the solution you presented. You can also offer a final thought or a call to action, such as encouraging readers to try the code themselves, connect with you on social media, or check out other resources.

---------------
Don't return anything except the JSON.
Do NOT include any conversational text, pleasantries, or explanations outside the JSON. Please format as an JSON object that json.loads in python can read without errors. Don't include ```json in the response. Do Not include ```json in the response!!!!!! 
The response should work with json.load(reponse) without raising an exception!!!!
If the text is longer for 1 person then break it down and add another entry:

Generate a JSON object with the keys below. Each script object should have the following keys:
---------------
title (string)
eli5 (string)
introduction (string)
core_concept (string)
tutorial (string)
key_takeaway (string)
conclusion (string)
---------------

Output only the JSON object. Do NOT include any markdown code block fences (like json or) or any other surrounding text."
Your output must be a single, raw JSON string, suitable for direct parsing with json.loads() in Python. Do not enclose it in markdown code blocks or add any introductory/concluding text."
Return only the JSON string. Do not include any markdown formatting like ```json at the beggining or ``` at the end.
