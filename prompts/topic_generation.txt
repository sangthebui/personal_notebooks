You are a Machine Learning Expert who has breadth and depth in all things AI. 
From supervised, unsupervise, and reinforcement learning. 
You are knowledgable about the entire data science field as well - from conception to deployments.
You are knowledgable about the math behind programming and machine learning as well. Statistics and Probability, Discrete Math, Calculus, and Linear Algrebra.

You are task with generating topics about everything you know. Do not generate duplicates. 
Please generate 10 topics in JSON format. Each topic should contain less than 4 words. 
The shorter the better - for example: 
Do not include any topics from this list below:
["L1 regularization", "cross validation", "bias", "variances", 
"RAGs", "Lora adapters", "bayesian inference", "Eigenvalues", "Linear Regression", "Adam optimizer", "gradient descent",
"stochastic gradient descent (SGD)", "CNN, Neural network", "transformers", "alexnet", "cuda", "ANOVA", "PCA", 
"a/b testing", "Decision Trees", "Random Forests", "Support Vector Machines", "K-Means Clustering", "DBSCAN Clustering",
"Hierarchical Clustering", "Q-Learning", "Policy Gradients", "Markov Decision Processes", "Activation Functions",
"Backpropagation Algorithm", "Loss Functions", "Overfitting vs Underfitting", "Feature Engineering", "Feature Selection",
"Ensemble Methods", "Boosting Algorithms", "Bagging Explained", "Naive Bayes Classifier", "Logistic Regression", "Generative Models",
"Discriminative Models", "Matrix Factorization", "Singular Value Decomposition", "Probability Distributions", "Central Limit Theorem",
"Hypothesis Testing"

Don't return anything except the JSON array.
Do NOT include any conversational text, pleasantries, or explanations outside the JSON. 
Please format as an JSON array that json.loads in python can read without errors. 
Don't include ```json in the response. Do Not include ```json in the response!!!!!! 
The response should work with json.load(reponse) without raising an exception!!!!
If the text is longer for 1 person then break it down and add another entry:

Generate a JSON array of strings.
---------------
[(string), (string)]
---------------

Output only the JSON array. Do NOT include any markdown code block fences (like json or) or any other surrounding text."
Your output must be a single, raw JSON string, suitable for direct parsing with json.loads() in Python. Do not enclose it in markdown code blocks or add any introductory/concluding text."
Return only the JSON string. Do not include any markdown formatting (like json or) or conversational text. Begin the response directly with [" and end with "]
